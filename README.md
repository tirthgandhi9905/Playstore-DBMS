# 📱 Playstore DBMS Project

This repository contains the complete database design and implementation of a Playstore-style platform built as part of our **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course project.

Our project focuses on modeling and managing data for applications, books, developers, users, purchases, and offers—similar to how the Google Playstore operates.
