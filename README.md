# üì± Playstore DBMS Project

This repository contains the **complete database design and implementation** of a Playstore-style platform, developed as part of our **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course project.

The project models real-world entities such as apps, books, developers, users, purchases, and promotional offers‚Äîmirroring the architecture and data flow of the Google Play Store.

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Normalized Schema**: All relations are in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
- ‚úÖ **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints maintain consistency across entities
- ‚úÖ **Logical Triggers**: Ensures valid operations like app downloads, purchases, and reviews
- ‚úÖ **Scalable Design**: Structured for potential expansion in future applications
- ‚úÖ **Real-World Entities**: Includes apps, users, developers, books, offers, and purchases

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** for schema implementation, constraints, and triggers
- **SQL** (DDL, Triggers, Normalization proofs)
- **Dia Software** for ER diagram design
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
